Jigsaw sponsored this effort and helped to comprehensively annotate the data.  In 2019, Kaggle held the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview) competition so that data scientists worldwide could work together to investigate ways to mitigate bias.\n",
